Purposeful Solutions Web Commerce Website (Prototype)
====================================================

How to run (no build tools required):
------------------------------------
Option A: Open index.html directly in your browser (works for most pages).
Option B (recommended): Serve locally so ES modules work consistently.

Using Node (if installed):
  npx http-server -p 8080

Then open:
  http://localhost:8080/index.html

Notes:
- This is a prototype for IT499. No backend. No real payments.
- Cart + order lookup data are stored in the browser via localStorage.
